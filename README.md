# Islandora Linked Taxonomies

A place to collect thoughts about linked taxonomies in Islandora.

## Concept

* One site acting as a hub hosting a taxonomy
* Other sites using that taxonomy as an endpoint for reference fields
* IF POSSIBLE: Allow those sites to write new data to that shared taxonomy

## Possible modules to make use of

* https://github.com/mjordan/autocomplete_endpoint?
* https://www.drupal.org/project/linked_data_field 
* https://github.com/digitalutsc/authority-link-auto-complete
